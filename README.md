## How to run backend server
1. Navigate to the server folder in the terminal (cd server).
2. Execute the server.js file using the command (npm run dev).
  - The terminal will display a message containing the local host and port number for the backend.
  - In case of any errors occurring during code modification, the server will automatically stop and automatically restart once the error is resolved.
## Problems
Maybe there is a need to install some modules like:
 - Express: npm install express
 - CORS: npm install cors
 - MySQL2: npm install mysql2
 - JWT: npm isntall jsonwebtoken
If there still exists any problem with a module, try installing it using the command npm install name_module."
